        <p>You look at the two paths and decide that the left looks just a little too sketchy for your liking. You turn right, trudging up the steadily increasing incline. Soon you come to a break in the trees and you see that you are standing at the top of a cliff. Looking down, you can see trees and just beyond the beach where you washed ashore. Stepping forward, you shade your eyes hoping to be able to see a rescue ship in the distance. All you see is empty ocean to the horizon.</p> 

        <p>As you stand, straining your eyes for just a glimpse, you feel a rumble beneath you. As you stumble back, you feel the earth begin to slide from beneath your feet, and realize that the cliff is only loose soil! You tumble down, skating on the loose of the scree and finally fetch up hard against the trunk of a huge palm at the bottom. The wind is knocked from your chest, but after a bit you get your breath back and you drag yourself up right. Looking up, you see that you are now at the base of the cliff, almost back where you started this morning.</p>
        
        <p>Sighing and saying a few choice words, you trudge back to the beach to sit and nurse your scrapes. Its almost night, better to rest and decide in the morning what to do next. Gathering wood for a fire, you make a small camp and curl up beside it, hoping to get some sleep. Hopefully the dawn will bring better prospects that todayâ€¦</p>
