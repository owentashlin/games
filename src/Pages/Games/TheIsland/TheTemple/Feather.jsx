        <p>You look at the idol and as your hand reaches forward, some intuition stays your hand. You remember all too well how that ended in every tale of adventure you have ever heard. The hero who takes the golden idol never ends well.</p> 

        <p>Looking at the other side of the scale, you examine the feather. It glints bright in the gloom, almost with a light of its own. The green blue hues ripple over its surface such that you canâ€™t entirely tell if its a real feather or something crafted of the finest gems. Entranced, you extend you hand out and brush you fingers along the length of the feather. Its surprisingly soft to the touch, and you find yourself picking it up carefully by the shaft.</p>

        <p>Holding the feather up a shaft of light coming through a crack in the roof, you see hints of peacock blue and a dusting of gold play along the surface. As you hold it aloft, you feel a monstrous pain sieze your whole body. You convulse, clutching the feather to yourself as you collapse to your knees in the dust of the cavernous room.</p>

        <p>As your eyes begin to blur from the pain, you look up and see the paintings on the walls of the room that you had failed to notice before. They seem to portray men with the faces of bird, with wings spread wide. As another cramp curls you in on yourself, you feel something push its way under your skin and then push through. Slowly, tears streaming down your face, you feel as the wings grow from your back until finally you stand in unconscious imitation of the hieroglyphs on the wall, emerald green wings spread wide. Walking out of the building, you see you are not alone. Other winged men and women are there, faces shrouded in masks of birds and foxes and deer.</p>

        <p>One man spreads his golden hawk wings wide, holding out an emerald green mask to you. You see your hands reaching out to it, feel yourself taking the mask and donning it, and you finally know that you are where you are meant to be.</p>
