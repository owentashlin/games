        <p>The Treasure, at last! You look at the two scales and know right away which one you came here to get. You carefully take the idol, cringing and just waiting for something to pop out at you or fall or something… But nothing happens. The scale doesn’t tip, nothing moves. You smile to yourself, thinking thing are looking up at last!</p> 

        <p>As you turn to go, there is the sound of stone scraping and you know you are about to have a deeply derivative moment as you look back over your shoulder. The scales are slowly tipping to the side with the feather, and the pedestal is starting to crumble. Cracks travel quickly outward, crazing up the walls as dust is kicked up by the shaking. You realize its not just the building as you run outside and see the whole village is shaking, building tumbling down even more than they already had. You run, the golden idol clutched to your chest and the earth shakes in your wake.</p> 

        <p>It seems like you race the earthquake all the way back to the beach, and as you stumble onto the sands just as the sun sets you can see the ocean retreating and a monstrous wave climbs up the horizon. You clutch your prize, and are helpless to stop it as the sea comes to claim you, dragging and the idol along in its wake. You lose hold of it and the last thing you feel before you run out of breath is the earth subsiding around you as if with this one great upheaval, some great beast has been appeased.</p>

        <p><strong>You Have Drowned</strong></p>
