        <p>The left hand fork looks just a little bit straighter, a little bit lighter. You decide to turn left, following along the path until you come to a small break in the trees. As you come out into the sun, you see a flash of orange and hear a rumbling growl from the other side of the clearing. A tiger paces slowly out of the gloom into the light, eyes locked on you. You freeze, unsure what to do next.</p>

        <p>Your monkey brain takes over, and you bolt! The tiger chases you, feet sure in the braken of the forest floor. You stumble over a fallen log, no idea where the path has gotten to, just trying to get away. You hit your head as you fall, mercifully blacking out before you feel the tigerâ€™s claws sink in.</p>
