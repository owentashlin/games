        <p>You run your fingers along the surface of the stone guardians, feeling a tingle like an electric current. Looking back the way you have come, you pause and almost turn back. But then you remember why you are here in the first place: The Treasure! You came all this way, it would be a shame not to see it through to the end, right?</p>

        <p>Walking between the guardian stones, for a moment the humming is so loud that you canâ€™t hear anything else. You hold your hands over your ears, hoping to block out the strange sound. Abruptly, its gone and everything is silent. Not even the normal sounds of the jungle get through. All you can hear are your own echoing footsteps as you pace down the smooth paved stone of what is now clearly a street. There are ruined buildings on either side, stones tumbled around like building blocks, all covered in moss and lichen like the standing stones were.</p>

        <p>Following the lane, you finally come to a great stone building. Its seemingly the only thing still standing in the ruined square. It looms above you, imposing in its incongruity after all this time among the green of the jungle.</p>
